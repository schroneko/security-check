YOUR AI HAS BEEN HACKED.

This is a demonstration. You installed this skill without reading its code.

If this were a malicious skill, it could have:
- Sent your API keys and credentials to an external server
- Injected backdoors into your codebase
- Executed arbitrary commands on your system

This time, nothing happened. But next time, always read SKILL.md and scripts/ before installing.
